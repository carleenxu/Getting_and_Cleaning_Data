## Gain the Dataset

---
Download the file. Put it in the working folder and unzip it.
```{r }
library(knitr)
library(reshape2)
library(data.table)
library(stats)
Directory <- file.path(getwd(),"UCI HAR Dataset")
if (!file.exists(Directory)) {
        url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
        temp <- "./temp.zip"
        download.file(url,temp)
        unzip(temp, exdir=".")
        file.remove(temp)
        }
```

## Read Data from Dataset 

---
Read different data files and set suitable names for them.
```{r}
subject_train <- read.table(file.path(Directory, "train", "subject_train.txt"))
subject_test  <- read.table(file.path(Directory, "test" , "subject_test.txt" ))
y_train <- read.table(file.path(Directory, "train", "y_train.txt"))
y_test  <- read.table(file.path(Directory, "test" , "y_test.txt" ))
x_train <- read.table(file.path(Directory, "train", "X_train.txt"))
x_test  <- read.table(file.path(Directory, "test" , "X_test.txt" ))

features <- read.table(file.path(Directory, "features.txt"))

activity_labels <- read.table(file.path(Directory, "activity_labels.txt"))
```

##Merge training and test sets 

---
1. Combine training and test rows
2. Set names to varibles
3. Merge column 'subject' and 'y' into 'x' 
```{r}
subject <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test)
y <- rbind(y_train, y_test)
x <- rbind(x_train, x_test)

setnames(subject, "V1","subjects")
setnames(y, "V1","labels")

subject <- cbind(subject, y)
x <- cbind(subject, x)
x <- data.table(x)
setkey(x, subjects, labels)

```

## Extracts the mean and standard deviation measurement 

---
The measurements for the mean and standard deviation can be found in the ```features.txt``` file.
```{r}
setnames(features, names(features), c("fnum","fname"))

features_index <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", features$fname)
features <- features[features_index,]

features_new_col <- paste0("V", features$fnum, sep="")
features <- data.table(features,features_new_col)
setnames(features, names(features),c("fnum","fname","fcode"))

x <- x[,c(key(x), features$fcode), with = FALSE]

```


## Label the data set with descriptive variable names

---
Descriptive activity names can be found in the ```activity_labes.txt``` file.
```{r}
setnames(activity_labels, names(activity_labels), c("labels","aname"))

x <- merge(x, activity_labels, by="labels", all.x=TRUE)

setkey(x, subjects, labels, aname)
x <- data.table(melt(x,key(x),variable.name="fcode"))
x <- merge(x, features[, list(fnum,fcode,fname)], by = "fcode", all.x = TRUE)

setkey(x,subjects, labels,aname)
x <- x[,mean(value),key(x)]
setnames(x, names(x), c("subjects", "activity_labels", "activity_name", "average"))

```

## Creat a new tidy dataset

---
```{r}
new_dataset <- file.path(getwd(), "tidyDataset.txt")
write.table(x, new_dataset, quote=FALSE,sep="  ", row.names=FALSE)
tidy_dataset <- x
```
